Fun Fact Friday! (#10)</strong></span>                      <p><strong>Canada and it's Military Tradition</strong></p><p>Canada's military was active in every theatre of war, though most battles occurred in Italy, Northwestern Europe, and the North Atlantic.<br>  <br>  Over the course of the war, <strong>1.1 million</strong> Canadians served in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Of these more than <strong>45,000</strong> lost their lives and another <strong>54,000</strong> were wounded. The financial cost was <strong>$21,786,077,519.13</strong>, between the 1939 and 1950. </p><p>By the end of the War, Canada had the world's <strong>fourth largest air force, and third largest navy.</strong> As well, the Canadian Merchant Navy completed over <strong>25,000</strong> voyages across the Atlantic. Many Allied pilots trained in Canada during the war. Canadians also served in the militaries of various Allied countries.</p><p>By <strong>D-Day, 6 June 1944</strong>, the landings at Normandy were accomplished by two beachheads made by the American forces at Omaha and Utah, two by British forces, Sword and Gold, and a final one at <strong>Juno made by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.</strong></p><p><strong>The Royal Canadian Navy</strong></p><p>Established following the introduction of the Naval Service Bill by then Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the Naval Service of Canada (NSC) was intended as a distinct naval force for the Dominion, that, should the need arise, could be placed under British control. The bill received royal assent on 4 May 1910. Initially equipped with two former Royal Navy vessels, HMCS Niobe and HMCS Rainbow, the service was renamed Royal Canadian Navy by King George V on 29 August 1911.<br>  <br>  During the first years of the First World War, the RCN's six-vessel naval force patrolled both the North American West and East coasts to deter the German naval threat, with a seventh ship, HMCS Shearwater joining the force in 1915. Just before the end of the war in 1918, the Royal Canadian Naval Air Service was established with the purpose of carrying out anti-submarine operations; however, it was disbanded after the armistice of 11 November.<br>  <br>  After the war, the Royal Canadian Navy took over certain responsibilities of the Department of Transport's Marine Service, and slowly started to build its fleet, with the first warships specifically designed for the RCN being commissioned in 1932. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the <strong>Navy had 11 combat vessels, 145 officers and 1,674 men</strong>. During the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy expanded significantly, ultimately gaining responsibility for the entire Northwest Atlantic theatre of war. By the end of the war, <strong>the RCN had become the third-largest allied navy in the world after the United States Navy and the Royal Navy.</strong> During the Battle of the Atlantic, the RCN sank 31 U-boats and sank or captured 42 enemy surface vessels, while successfully completing 25,343 merchant crossings. The Navy lost 24 ships and 1,797 sailors in the war.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>                      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>                      <p><span class="style5">  <br>                      </span></p>            <span class="style5"><br>			<br>			<br>			<br>			  <br>			  <br>            <br>			</span><br>					  <br>				      &nbsp;</span></p>				  </td>				  <td valign="top" style="width: 463px">					<div align="center">					  <p><img src="Canadian Navy.jpg" width="349" height="269"><br>					    <br>				        <strong>3rd Canadian Division - North Nova Scotia Highlanders<br>				      on D-Day at Juno Beach				      </strong></p>					  <p><img src="Dday Canada.jpg" width="400" height="310"></p>					  <p><strong>North Nova Scotia Highlanders and their Bikes!</strong></p>					  <p><br>					    <img src="NNS Highlanders and their bikes.png" width="400" height="302"><br><br>					    <br>			          <strong> The Canadian Military provided every soldier in the infantry <br>			          with a bicycle to ride to Caen.
