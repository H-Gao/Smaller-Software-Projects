Fun Fact Friday! (#8)</strong></span></p><p>Dionne Quintuplets!</p>                      <p>&nbsp;On May 28, 1934, five identical girls are born to Elzire and Oliva Dionne in Callander, Ontario. The five sisters - Annette, Cecile, Yvonne, Marie and &Eacute;milie - become known as the Dionne quintuplets, and together they weigh less than 6.5 kilograms. Against all expectations, they survive their first weeks.&nbsp;<br>                        <br>                        Oliva, already poor with five children, was approached by fair exhibitors for&nbsp;Chicago's&nbsp;Century of Progress&nbsp;exhibition within days of their birth, who wished to put the Quintuplets on display and show them to the world. The parents were persuaded to agree, and although the contract was revoked before it was ever put into effect, it raised the issue of exploitation of the children.<br>                        <br>                        Four months after the birth of the sisters, the&nbsp;Ontario government&nbsp;intervened and found the parents to be unfit for the quintuplets (although not for their previous children). Custody of the five babies was withdrawn from their parents by the&nbsp;Lieutenant Governor-in-Council, on the advice of&nbsp;Premier&nbsp;Mitchell Hepburn, in 1935, originally for a guardianship of two years. Although Oliva Dionne remained part of the guardianship, the children were put under the guidance of Dr. Dafoe and two other guardians. The stated reason for removing the quintuplets from their parents' legal custody was to ensure their survival and the girls became wards of the state (til they were 18 years old).   The irony of saving them from exploitation in Chicago to exploit them in Ontario seemed to go unnoticed.<br>                        <br>                      For the first nine years of their lives, they live at a hospital in their hometown (across the street from where they were born) that becomes a tourist mecca called "Quintland." &nbsp;The compound had an outdoor playground designed to be a public observation area. It was surrounded by a covered arcade that allowed tourists to observe the sisters behind one-way screens. Approximately 6,000 people per day visited the observation gallery that surrounded the outdoor playground to view the Dionne sisters. Ample parking was provided and almost 3,000,000 people walked through the gallery between 1934 and 1943. <br>                      <br>                      The Ministry of Public Welfare sets up a trust fund in their behalf with assurances that the financial well-being of the entire Dionne family would be taken care of "for all their normal needs for the rest of their lives."&nbsp;<br>                        <br>                      Between 1934 and 1943, about 3 million people visit Quintland. The government and nearby businesses make an estimated half-billion dollars off the tourists, much of which the Dionne family never sees. The sisters were the nation's biggest tourist attraction during these years- bigger than Niagara Falls.<br>                      <br>                      DID YOU KNOW?<br>                      &bull; The Dionnes had five children prior to the quintuplets and then three more after the quintuplets were born!!!<br>                      * Oliva Dionne (mother) ran a souvenir shop and a concession store opposite the nursery                       .  She also sold stones from the Dionne farm that were supposed to have some magical power of fertility.                      <br>                      <br>                      Aftermath<br>                      *                       After nine years and a bitter custody fight, the girls moved back with their parents and their other siblings. They received only a fraction of the promised financial returns.&nbsp;<br>                      * The quintuplets left the family home upon turning 18 years old in 1952, and had little contact with their parents afterwards.                      <br>                      &bull; There is still a mystery surrounding what happened to the money the Ontario government placed in a trust fund for the quints, though it's believed that most of the funds went to pay for the many employees of "Quintland."&nbsp;<br>                      &bull; After years of wrangling over compensation, the Ontario government formally apologized to the surviving quints on March 6, 1998. The government offered the quints a $4-million lump-sum payment, which the quints accepted after having rejected a previous offer of only $2000 a month.&nbsp;<br>                      &bull; In 2002, there are only 2 surviving Dionne quints. &Eacute;milie died of an epileptic seizure in 1954; Marie died of a blood clot in 1970; and Yvonne died of cancer in 2001.&nbsp;<br>                      &bull; The odds of giving birth to identical quintuplets without the aid of reproductive technology are one in 57 million.&nbsp;<br>                      <br>                      <br><p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>                      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>                      <p><span class="style5">  <br>                      </span></p>            <span class="style5"><br>			<br>			<br>			<br>			  <br>			  <br>            <br>			</span><br>					  <br>				      &nbsp;</span></p>				  </td>					<td valign="top" style="width: 463px">					<div align="center">					  <p><br>					    Ontario passed the Dionne Quintuplets Guardianship Act to protect the girls and "ensure their advancement, education and welfare" because "they are the only known living quintuplets and as such are therefore of special interest to the people of Canada and to people of other countries." <br>					    <br><br><img src="0_dionne-1.jpg" width="331" height="271" alt="ds"><br>					    <br>					  </p>					  <p><img src="0_dionne-2.jpg" width="405" height="311" alt="fd"><br>					    <br>					    <br>					    <br>				      </p>					  <p><br>					    <br>					    <br>					    <br><br>					    <br>					    <br><br>				      </p>                    </div>					<br>					<br></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td valign="top" style="width: 462px">&nbsp;</td>					<td valign="top" style="width: 463px">&nbsp;</td>				</tr>			</table>			</td>	      </tr>		  </table>		  		<hr size="1" color="#999999">		  <br>		  <br><br>		<td width="25">			<img src="images/Web_Template_04.gif" width="25" height="100%" alt="right"></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td colspan="3">			<img src="images/Web_Template_05.gif" width="1000" height="27" alt=""></td>	</tr></table><!-- End ImageReady Slices --><br></center><map name="Map"></map><map name="Map2"></map><map name="Map3"></map><map name="Map4"></map></body></html>
