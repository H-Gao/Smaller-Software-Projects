Fun Fact Friday! (#11)</strong></span>                      <p><strong>Canada and it's Relationship with the Netherlands</strong></p><p>One of the most important Canadian contributions was the Battle of the Scheldt, involving the II Canadian Corps under the Canadian 1st Army. The Corps included the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. Although nominally a Canadian formation, II Canadian Corps contained the Polish 1st Armoured Division, with the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, and the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade. The British 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was attached to the Corps.<br>  The British had liberated <strong>Antwerp</strong>, but that city's port could not be used until the Germans were driven from the heavily fortified <strong>Scheldt estuary.</strong></p><p> In several weeks of heavy fighting in the fall of 1944, the Canadians succeeded in defeating the Germans in this region. The Canadians then turned east and played a central role in the liberation of the Netherlands. <strong>In 1944&ndash;45, First Canadian Army was responsible for liberating much of the Netherlands from German occupation.</strong> Canada lost <strong>7 600</strong> troops in these operations. This day is celebrated on May 5th commemorating the surrender of the German Commander-in-chief Johannes Blaskowitz to Canadian general Canadian Charles Foulkes, leader of the Canadian I Corps.<br>  <br>  The royal family of the Netherlands had moved to Ottawa until the Netherlands were liberated, and <strong>Princess Margriet</strong> was born during this Canadian exile. Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, the only child of then&ndash;Queen Wilhelmina and heir to the throne, sought refuge in Canada with her two daughters, Beatrix and Irene, during the war. During Princess Juliana&rsquo;s stay in Canada, preparations were made for the birth of her third child. <strong>To ensure the Dutch citizenship of this royal baby, the Canadian Parliament passed a special law declaring Princess Juliana&rsquo;s suite at the Ottawa Civic Hospital &ldquo;extraterritorial&rdquo;.</strong> On 19 January 1943, Princess Margriet was born. The day after Princess Margriet&rsquo;s birth, the <strong>Dutch flag was flown on the Peace Tower.</strong> This was the only time a foreign flag has waved atop Canada&rsquo;s Parliament Buildings.<br>  <br>  In 1945, the people of the Netherlands sent <strong>100,000</strong> hand-picked tulip bulbs as a post-war gift for the role played by Canadian soldiers in the liberation of the Netherlands. These tulips were planted on Parliament Hill and along the Queen Elizabeth Driveway. Princess Juliana was so pleased at the prominence given to the gift that in 1946, she decided to send a personal gift of 20,000 tulip bulbs to show her gratitude for the hospitality received in Ottawa. The gift was part of a lifelong bequest. Since then, tulips have proliferated in Ottawa as a symbol of peace, freedom and international friendship. Every year, Canada&rsquo;s capital receives <strong>10,000</strong> bulbs from the Dutch royal family, celebrated in the Canadian Tulip Festival. In 1995, the Netherlands donated an additional 5,000 bulbs for Parliament Hill, 1,000 for each provincial and territorial capital and 1,000 for Ste. Anne's hospital in Saint-Anne-de-Bellevue, Que. (the only remaining federal hospital in Canada, administered by Veterans Affairs Canada)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>                      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>                      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>                      <p><span class="style5">  <br>                      </span></p>            <span class="style5"><br>			<br>			<br>			<br>			  <br>			  <br>            <br>			</span><br>					  <br>				      &nbsp;</span></p>				  </td>				  <td valign="top" style="width: 463px">					<div align="center">					  <p><img src="Margriet_von_Oranien-Nassau.jpg" width="286" height="425"><br>					    <br>			          <strong>Princess Margriet of the Netherlands</strong></p>					  <p><img src="Operation_Manna_-_Many_Thanks_In_Tulips.jpg" width="400" height="313"><br><br><strong>&quot;Many Thanks&quot; written in Tulips after Operation Manna</strong></p>					  <p><br>					    <br>  <br>				      </p>                    </div>					<br>					<br></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td valign="top" style="width: 462px">&nbsp;</td>					<td valign="top" style="width: 463px">&nbsp;</td>				</tr>			</table>			</td>	      </tr>		  </table>		  		<hr size="1" color="#999999">		  <br>		  <br><br>		<td width="25">			<img src="images/Web_Template_04.gif" width="25" height="100%" alt="right"></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td colspan="3">			<img src="images/Web_Template_05.gif" width="1000" height="27" alt=""></td>	</tr></table><!-- End ImageReady Slices --><br></center><map name="Map"></map><map name="Map2"></map><map name="Map3"></map><map name="Map4"></map></body></html>
