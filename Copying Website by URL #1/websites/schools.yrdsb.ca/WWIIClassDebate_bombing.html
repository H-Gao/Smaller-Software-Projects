Hitler responded by going ahead with the&nbsp;<strong>Blitz,</strong>&nbsp;successive raids on each British cities.</span></p>		  <p>&nbsp;</p>		  <p><strong><em>AREA BOMBING / STRATEGIC BOMBING</em></strong></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By end of 1940<span lang="EN-GB">, Britain realized that the only way to fight the Nazis in Europe was through heavy bombers and strategic bombing</span></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">Unfortunately, Britain's air force began to realise that its bombers were not able to find and hit specific war targets such as airfields or armament factories.&nbsp;</span><strong>1 in 5</strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;aircraft was succeeding in dropping its bombs within five miles of its target.</span></strong><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;Britain realized that due to this, the bombing offensive could only be effective if it was&nbsp;<strong>directed at targets as big as cities</strong>.</span></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">In February 1942, Bomber Command was instructed to shift the focus onto the 'morale of the enemy civil population' called &ldquo;<strong>area bombing</strong>&rdquo;</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This meant that the targets for bombing raids were&nbsp;<strong>NO LONGER&nbsp;</strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB">military or industrial installations</span></strong><span lang="EN-GB">, but a church or other significant spot in the centre of industrial towns. This was because nearly everybody living in an 'industrial town' was considered to contribute directly or indirectly to the German war effort, and had therefore become a supposedly legitimate target.</span></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">The Allies realized that fire was the most effective means of destroying a town, so the bombers now carried mainly&nbsp;<strong>incendiary bombs</strong>.</span></p>		  <p><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>		  <p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>BOMBER HARRIS</em></strong></span></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">One week after the area bombing directive was issued, Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris was appointed as the new head of British Bomber Command. Harris believed that air power could be decisive in winning modern wars, and could help to prevent the slaughter of ground forces that he had witnessed in the trenches of World War One.</span></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">Harris launched 'thousand bomber raids' on big cities in Germany such as Cologne or Hamburg, whose scale of destruction made Harris confident that the Germans citizens morale would break, Germany&rsquo;s military resources and production would crumble and Germany would collapse by 1943</span></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">By 1944, it was not, as Harris had expected, the destruction of German cities that proved decisive for the Allies - it was the&nbsp;<strong>superiority of the RAF over the Luftwaffe in the air</strong>. It enabled the bomber forces to neutralise strategic and tactical targets in France, which was crucial for the success of the D-Day landings and the subsequent advance of Allied ground forces.</span></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">At the onset of winter, Bomber Command's focus shifted back onto area targets. In October and November 1944, Harris's force dropped more than&nbsp;<strong>60% of their bomb tonnage on German cities.</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">Hence the last months of the war saw yet another escalation of the bombing war. By then, most German towns of industrial importance were all but destroyed. Yet the Nazis were still fighting back. Every day, they were killing thousands on the battlefield and in the concentration camps. Hitler's V rockets were spreading death and terror amongst civilians in Britain.</span></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">Since the heavy bombers were running out of targets, towns were now put on the target lists that had little military or industrial importance.</span></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">Churchill thought that the bombing of communication centres in eastern Germany might aid the Soviet advance on Berlin. Bomber Command was ordered to attack Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig and other east German cities to 'cause confusion in the evacuation from the east' and 'hamper the movements of troops from the west'.<br>		    <br>		    </span></p>		  <p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>OVERALL STATS:&nbsp;</em></strong></span></p>		  <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">both the Axis and Allies used strategic bombing and conventional bombings to hinder war production.&nbsp;&nbsp;This resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties, similar to that of the atomic bombs:<br>		    -Battle of Britian- over 146, 700 civilians killed or injured<br>		    -Air Raids in Germany &ndash; approximately 600 000 civliians killed<br>		    -Firebombing of Dresden (German city)- 135 000 Germans killed<br>		    -Firebombing of Toyko- 83 000 killed, majority civilians.</span></p>		  <p><br>		    <br>		    <br>		  Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/area_bombing_01.shtml </p>		  <p>&nbsp;</p>		  <p>&nbsp;</p>		  <p>&nbsp;</p>		  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>		  <p class="MsoNormal"><br>		  <br><br>          <script src="http://xyz.freelogs.com/counter/script.php?u=melnyk99"></script>	  </p></td>		<td width="25">			<img src="images/Web_Template_04.gif" width="25" height="100%" alt="right"></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td colspan="3">			<img src="images/Web_Template_05.gif" width="1000" height="27" alt=""></td>	</tr></table><!-- End ImageReady Slices --><br></center><map name="Map"></map><map name="Map2"></map><map name="Map3"></map><map name="Map4"></map></body></html>
